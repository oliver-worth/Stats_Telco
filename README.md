## Project Description
Megaline offers two prepaid plans with different pricing models and allowances. This project aims to analyze customer data from 2018 to determine which plan is more profitable and to understand customer usage patterns. The analysis includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and hypothesis testing.

## Surf Plan
- Monthly charge: $20
- Included: 500 minutes, 50 texts, 15 GB of data
Overage charges:
- 1 minute: 3 cents
- 1 text: 3 cents
- 1 GB of data: $10
## Ultimate Plan
- Monthly charge: $70
- Included: 3000 minutes, 1000 texts, 30 GB of data
Overage charges:
- 1 minute: 1 cent
- 1 text: 1 cent
- 1 GB of data: $7

## Data
The analysis is based on five datasets containing information about customers, their usage patterns, and the plans they are subscribed to:

- megaline_users.csv: Contains user information including ID, name, age, city, and plan.
- megaline_calls.csv: Contains call records including call duration and user ID.
- megaline_messages.csv: Contains records of text messages sent.
- megaline_internet.csv: Contains records of internet usage.
- megaline_plans.csv: Contains details about the different calling plans.

## Project Structure
This project follows these key steps:

1. Data Preparation and Cleaning: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing user behavior and plan performance.
3. Hypothesis Testing: Testing hypotheses about revenue differences between plans and regions.
4. Conclusion: Summarizing findings and making recommendations.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
Data Types and Conversion
- Converted ID columns to integers where necessary.
- Ensured date columns were correctly formatted as datetime objects.

## Error Handling and Data Cleaning
- Identified and removed duplicate entries.
- Addressed missing values by filling them with appropriate substitutes or removing rows where necessary.

## Monthly Aggregation
For each user, calculated:

- Monthly call usage: Total calls and minutes used.
- Monthly messages: Total text messages sent.
- Monthly internet usage: Total data used (converted to GB).
- Monthly revenue: Based on plan limits and overage charges, calculated the monthly revenue generated by each user.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Customer Behavior Analysis
#### Duration of Calls
- Surf Plan: Slightly below 400 minutes per month on average, with a wider distribution of call durations, indicating variability in usage.
- Ultimate Plan: Median call duration is around 400 minutes per month, with a maximum of 1431 minutes. The usage is more consistent, with less dispersion in the data.

Insight: Ultimate plan users generally use fewer minutes than their allowance. Adjusting the plan’s minute allowance could be considered, though it might deter customers from choosing this plan.

#### Total Messages
- Surf Plan: Median of around 35 messages per month, with some instances of exceeding the plan’s limit, benefiting the company from overage charges.
- Ultimate Plan: Median between 40-45 messages per month, with less variation in the number of messages sent, indicating more consistent usage.
  
Insight: Ultimate plan users tend to stay within their message allowance, while Surf plan users occasionally exceed theirs, providing additional revenue.

####  Revenue Analysis
- Surf Plan: Median revenue per user is around $46 per month, with significant variability.
- Ultimate Plan: Median revenue per user is slightly above $70 per month, with less variability.

Conclusion: The Ultimate plan generally brings in higher average revenue per user, largely due to its higher base fee. The Surf plan, while having a lower base fee, generates additional revenue through overage charges, leading to more variability in revenue.

## Statistical Metrics
- Mean: Calculated the average usage (minutes, texts, data) for each plan.
- Variance and Standard Deviation: Measured the dispersion of usage data to understand variability in customer behavior.

## Data Visualization
- Histograms: Plotted histograms to visualize distributions of call minutes, texts, and data usage for each plan.
- Box Plots: Used box plots to identify outliers and compare distributions.

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis 1: Revenue Difference Between Plans
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in average revenue between Surf and Ultimate plan users.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in average revenue between Surf and Ultimate plan users.
- Test Used: Independent sample t-test.


## Hypothesis 2: Regional Revenue Differences
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in average revenue between users in the NY-NJ area and users from other regions.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in average revenue between users in the NY-NJ area and users from other regions.
- Test Used: Independent sample t-test.
- p-value: 0.006851885492911961
- Result: We accept that the average revenue in the NY-NJ area is different from the average for all the other areas.

##  Conclusion
### Duration of Calls
- The Ultimate plan has a slightly higher average median duration of minutes on the phone per month (400 minutes) compared to the Surf plan. The maximum number of minutes used in a month for Ultimate users was 1431 minutes, which is well below the plan's limits.

### Total Messages
- Ultimate plan users send more text messages on average (40-45 messages per month) compared to Surf users, who send around 35 messages. The variation in message usage is also lower for Ultimate users.
### Data Usage
- Ultimate plan users have a higher median data usage (16-18 GB per month) compared to Surf plan users (14-16 GB). The data usage is more consistent for Ultimate users.
### Revenue Analysis
- The Ultimate plan generates higher median revenue per user at around $71 per month, while the Surf plan generates around $46. Although Surf has a lower base fee, the variability in revenue suggests that overage charges contribute significantly to its total revenue.
### Hypothesis Testing
- There is a statistically significant difference in average revenue between the Surf and Ultimate plans.
- There is also a statistically significant difference in average revenue between users in the NY-NJ area and users from other regions.
### Future Work
- Predictive Modeling: Develop models to predict which plan a new user should be offered based on their expected usage patterns.
- Churn Analysis: Investigate factors contributing to customer churn and suggest strategies for improving retention.
- Customer Segmentation: Perform cluster analysis to identify different customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
