## Project Description
Megaline offers two prepaid plans with different pricing models and allowances. This project aims to analyze customer data from 2018 to determine which plan is more profitable and to understand customer usage patterns. The analysis includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and hypothesis testing.

## Surf Plan
- Monthly charge: $20
- Included: 500 minutes, 50 texts, 15 GB of data
Overage charges:
- 1 minute: 3 cents
- 1 text: 3 cents
- 1 GB of data: $10
## Ultimate Plan
- Monthly charge: $70
- Included: 3000 minutes, 1000 texts, 30 GB of data
Overage charges:
- 1 minute: 1 cent
- 1 text: 1 cent
- 1 GB of data: $7

## Data
The analysis is based on five datasets containing information about customers, their usage patterns, and the plans they are subscribed to:

- megaline_users.csv: Contains user information including ID, name, age, city, and plan.
- megaline_calls.csv: Contains call records including call duration and user ID.
- megaline_messages.csv: Contains records of text messages sent.
- megaline_internet.csv: Contains records of internet usage.
- megaline_plans.csv: Contains details about the different calling plans.

## Project Structure
This project follows these key steps:

1. Data Preparation and Cleaning: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing user behavior and plan performance.
3. Hypothesis Testing: Testing hypotheses about revenue differences between plans and regions.
4. Conclusion: Summarizing findings and making recommendations.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
Data Types and Conversion
- Converted ID columns to integers where necessary.
- Ensured date columns were correctly formatted as datetime objects.

## Error Handling and Data Cleaning
- Identified and removed duplicate entries.
- Addressed missing values by filling them with appropriate substitutes or removing rows where necessary.

## Monthly Aggregation
For each user, calculated:

- Monthly call usage: Total calls and minutes used.
- Monthly messages: Total text messages sent.
- Monthly internet usage: Total data used (converted to GB).
- Monthly revenue: Based on plan limits and overage charges, calculated the monthly revenue generated by each user.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Customer Behavior Analysis
- Call Usage: Analyzed the distribution of call minutes across different plans.
- Message Usage: Compared the number of messages sent by users on different plans.
- Internet Usage: Investigated data consumption trends and compared them across plans.

## Statistical Metrics
- Mean: Calculated the average usage (minutes, texts, data) for each plan.
- Variance and Standard Deviation: Measured the dispersion of usage data to understand variability in customer behavior.

## Data Visualization
- Histograms: Plotted histograms to visualize distributions of call minutes, texts, and data usage for each plan.
- Box Plots: Used box plots to identify outliers and compare distributions.

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis 1: Revenue Difference Between Plans
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in average revenue between Surf and Ultimate plan users.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in average revenue between Surf and Ultimate plan users.
- Test Used: [Specify the test, e.g., t-test for independent samples].
- Results: [State whether you rejected the null hypothesis and what the p-value was].

## Hypothesis 2: Regional Revenue Differences
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in average revenue between users in the NY-NJ area and users from other regions.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in average revenue between users in the NY-NJ area and users from other regions.
- Test Used: [Specify the test, e.g., t-test for independent samples].
- Results: [State whether you rejected the null hypothesis and what the p-value was].

Conclusion
Summarize the key findings:

Revenue Comparison: Which plan generates more revenue and why?
Customer Behavior: Any significant patterns in customer behavior that could inform marketing strategies or plan adjustments?
Hypothesis Testing: What conclusions were drawn from the hypothesis tests?
Example Conclusion: "The analysis indicates that the Ultimate plan, despite its higher monthly fee, generates less revenue on average compared to the Surf plan. This is primarily due to the fact that Surf users frequently exceed their plan limits, leading to additional charges. The hypothesis testing further revealed a significant revenue difference between the two plans, confirming that Surf is more profitable. Additionally, the revenue generated by users in the NY-NJ area does not significantly differ from that of users in other regions."

Future Work
Outline potential next steps:

Predictive Modeling: Build models to predict which plan a new user should be marketed based on their usage patterns.
Churn Analysis: Investigate factors contributing to user churn and develop strategies to improve retention.
Customer Segmentation: Perform cluster analysis to identify different customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
